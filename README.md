# ubuntu-boilerplate
This script sets up an ubuntu box with all my preferences and configurations.  It instsall things like git, htop, build-essential, my dotfiles, and some commonly used programming languages.  It's a great starting place for an EC2 instance.

# usage
Copy the contents of start.sh to a file on your ubuntu server then run:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wellsjo/ubuntu-boilerplate/master/start; ./start;
```
